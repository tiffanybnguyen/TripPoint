# TripPoint

This project reads the latitude and longitude data stored within a GPX file to create a new csv file called triplog.csv and extracts information. Then, the program transforms the CSV into useful metrics to analyze the data (Ex. finding the total distance traveled during the trip or the average speed). This project also ensures quality by removing excess points that are grouped together, also known as "stops".

# Note:
A GPX file is a GPS data file saved in the GPS Exchange format, which is an open standard used by many GPS programs. It contains latitude and longitude location data that may include waypoints, routes, and tracks. A CSV file is a comma-separated values file commonly used by spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel. It contains plain text data sets separated by commas, with each new line in the CSV file representing a new database row and each database row consisting of one or more fields separated by a comma.
